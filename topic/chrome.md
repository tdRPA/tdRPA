### About chrome force-renderer-accessibility

Chrome supports treating browser Web UI elements as native elements so they can be automated through Windows UIA. You just need to launch Chrome with the argument `--force-renderer-accessibility` :
`"C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe" --force-renderer-accessibility`
