### FAQ

##### 1. What do the aaRole and aaState properties of Windows Native UI elements mean in tdSelector?
These are two properties of the early Windows UI automation technology MSAA (Microsoft Active Accessibility): aaRole represents the element type, and aaState represents the element state. In actual usage, these two values are rarely modified. They are used as element search conditions by selecting or deselecting them.
