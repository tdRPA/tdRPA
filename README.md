## 1. What is tdRPA
tdRPA is an RPA SDK for software developers. Developers can use their familiar languages and development tools to develop new RPA applications or integrate RPA functionality into existing systems

## 2. System Components
![tdRPA_architecture](./market/tdRPA_architecture.png)
- tdSelector: An element picker that visually picks UI elements and generates element lookup expressions
- tdLocator: Element locator, used to locate the corresponding UI element based on the element search expression generated by tdSelector. After locating the UI element, you can freely access and call its properties and methods
- tdWorker： Encapsulates common tasks into simple commands for direct invocation; simplifies RPA workflow creation, improves development efficiency, and ensures more stable, reliable, and maintainable processes
- tdPower： Encapsulates common AI capabilities (TBD)
- Third-party Extension Capabilities: Drives tech innovations and builds a developer and commercial ecosystem
