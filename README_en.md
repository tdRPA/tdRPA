## 1. What is tdRPA
tdRPA is an RPA SDK for software developers. Developers can use their familiar languages and development tools to develop new RPA applications or integrate RPA functionality into existing systems

## 2. tdRPA has three components
- tdSelector: An element picker that visually picks UI elements and generates element lookup expressions
- tdBot: An element operation executor that performs corresponding operations on UI elements based on the element lookup expressions generated by tdSelector. The related functions are provided in the form of restful API
- tdSDK: The restful API of tdBot is provided to different developers in the form of SDK, supporting various languages such as Java, Python, C#, Nodejs, and Javascript

## 3. tdRPA Features
|**Most RPA Suite**   |  **tdRPA** |
| ------------ | ------------ |
|Low-code platform, aimed at business users|SDK, aimed at professional software developers|
|Integrated Development Environment, all-in-one|Focus only on UI automation operations|
|Cannot be packaged as a standalone executable for distribution and deployment|Can be|
|Not easy to integrate as a software module into existing application systems|Easy|
|Proprietary visual designer combined with embedded code functionality|Use familiar programming languages and development tools|
|Code functionality, specific or limited programming languages|Most languages, based on [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen "swagger-codegen")|
|Visual programming, low efficiency, chaotic and dizzying|Code-based, precise and flexible|
|Poor version management|Good|
|Local Deployment|Robots are called through restful API, can be remotely controlled, easy for group control|

## 4.Download
- github [https://github.com/tdRPA/tdRPA/releases](https://github.com/tdRPA/tdRPA/releases)
- gitee [https://gitee.com/tdRPA/tdRPA/releases](https://gitee.com/tdRPA/tdRPA/releases)

## 5. Installation
- tdSelector: No installation required, just unzip the file
- tdBot: No installation required, just unzip the file
- tdSDK: Currently, only the Python SDK is available. To install it, navigate to the directory containing `setup.py` in the command line and run `python setup.py install`

## 6. Usage
- tdSelector: Run `selector.exe`, the shortcut key for element picking is `ctrl` and cancel is `esc`
- tdBot: Run `tdbot.exe`, the default address for the executor restful API is `127.0.0.1:8864`, which can be modified by starting it through the command line. The parameter format is `tdbot.exe [ip] [port]`. To view the definition and debug of the restful API, go to [http://127.0.0.1:8864/swagger/index.html](http://127.0.0.1:8864/swagger/index.html)
- tdSDK: The Python SDK usage demonstration is as follows, and it is similar for other languages


```python
    #Import the tdbot package
    import tdbot
    
    #Set the RESTful API and executor running address to be called
    config=tdbot.Configuration()
    config.host='http://127.0.0.1:8864'
    
    #Create the client
    client=tdbot.ApiClient(config)
    
    #Create the mouse API object
    mouseApi=tdbot.MouseApi(client)
    #Create the target object, and the selector string is copied from tdSelector
    target=tdbot.Target(selector="[  { 'wnd' : [ ('Text' , 'tdbot') , ('aaRole' , '10') , ('App' , 'explorer.exe') ] } ,  { 'ctrl' : [ ('Text' , 'UIRibbonDockTop') , ('aaRole' , '10') ] } ,  { 'ctrl' : [ ('Text' , 'Ribbon') , ('aaRole' , '10') ] } ,  { 'ctrl' : [ ('Text' , 'Ribbon') , ('aaRole' , '10') ] } ,  { 'ctrl' : [ ('aaRole' , '10') ] } ,  { 'ctrl' : [ ('Text' , 'Ribbon') , ('aaRole' , '38') ] } ,  { 'ctrl' : [ ('Text' , '下层功能区') , ('aaRole' , '16') ] } ,  { 'ctrl' : [ ('aaRole' , '10') ] } ,  { 'ctrl' : [ ('Text' , '主页') , ('aaRole' , '38') ] } ,  { 'ctrl' : [ ('Text' , '新建') , ('aaRole' , '22') ] } ,  { 'ctrl' : [ ('Text' , '新建文件夹') , ('aaRole' , '43') ] }]")
    #Call the mouse click command
    mouseApi.mouse_click_target(body=target)
    {'id': '8a8fe04c-0461-11ee-9cad-9cc6b1b7ea87'}
```

## 7. Additional idea
- tdRPA is currently in version 1.0beta and mainly implements the generation and parsing of selector element expressions, as well as the lookup function for UI elements. Only two mouse operations (clicking and hovering) have been implemented for UI element operations, and other operations will be added gradually in the future. Suggestions for application requirements are welcome to improve the UI element operation function in a requirement-driven manner
- tdRPA currently only implements the element operation function for Windows native applications. To operate browser applications, please search for `chrome force-renderer-accessibility`, which is a way to operate browser web UI elements as native elements. The next step is to better support browser operations, and automation for mobile applications has not been considered yet
- The initial plan is to offer free use for personal applications and charge a small fee for commercial applications. Of course, if donations and appreciation can support the development work to continue, it will be completely free
